# Additional Elements
- __A Server__: This additional server has been added to increase the overall capacity and resources available to handle incoming traffic and process requests, enabling the infrastructure to scale more effectively.

- __Load Balancer Cluster__: Configuring the load balancers as a cluster enhances scalability and fault tolerance. If one load balancer fails, the other one can continue to distribute traffic, ensuring high availability. Additionally, distributing traffic across multiple load balancers improves performance by reducing the load on individual devices.

- __Split Components__: Separating components onto their own servers allows for better resource allocation and scalability. Each component can scale independently based on its specific requirements, and any performance issues or resource constraints in opne component wil not directly impact the others. Again, failures in one component are less likely to affect the entire system.
